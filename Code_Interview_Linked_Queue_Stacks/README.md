# Code Interview Linked Queue Stacks

In this activity, which presented some problems involving linked lists and stacks, typical of interviews, I answered and the solution was posted on ChatGPT to be optimized. Few things were changed with this action: adding a base test for the first problem and the enumerate() function, specific to lists.

As for the difficulties, I only had them in the second question, concerning the merging of two linked lists, to think of all possible insertion cases.
