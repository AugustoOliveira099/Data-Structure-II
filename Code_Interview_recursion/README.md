# Code_Interview_recursion

In this fourth week of class, an activity was given on recursive functions. The use of ChatGPT was allowed to assist in the construction of the function, however, I think it takes away my ability to deeply understand the subject matter. Therefore, I did not use this tool.

The task required a video to be recorded using the Loom extension, explaining how the functions were developed. The video link is provided below:
