# Binary Search Tree

In week 6 of Algorithms and Data Structure II, I studied Binary Search Tree (BST). This is an activity where we need to work with BST to solve the problem. The problem asks us to implement a function that receives the tree and the value of three nodes as parameters, and returns True if node one or node three is the predecessor of node two, and the other is a successor.
