# Building Fast Queries on a CSV

In week 5 of Algorithms and Data Structure II, I studied time complexity, space complexity. In week 6, I studied sorting algorithms complexity.

To develop these skills, this code was implemented, which aims to highlight the importance of understanding time complexity and space complexity. Additionally, a function based on binary search was also implemented.

It is an algorithm that reads a list of laptops with various properties from a CSV file and has several functions:
* Find a laptop by ID conventionally and quickly, using the acquired knowledge;
* Indicate whether it is possible to buy one or two laptops, or none (boolean), based on a provided value D;
* Indicate the index at which the laptops with a price greater than the provided value D start, return -1 if all laptops can be purchased.
